# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet once a week every Tuesday at 1:00 PM in person, and the meetings will range anywhere from 1-2 hours based on what we need to complete that week and if there are any problems that arise. At the team meeting, we will all work together to fill out the weekly development log. This way, one person is not stuck filling it out every week. These team meetings will serve as the basis for planning for the week and checking in on progress.
2. **Assistance** 
Each team member is currently connected through Snapchat groups and Discord. These two mediums will serve as the basis for communication between each member. Since we are all generally available on these platforms, group members can expect timely responses from other members.
3. **Respect** 
Every week, a different member of the group will be selected to lead the meeting and discussion for that week. This will allow all of us to have some sort of leadership throughout the entire development process. In our weekly meetings, all ideas will be discussed with respect to all ideas. The weekly lead will aid this process and allow for open collaboration. 
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
Each week, at the meeting, we will decide upon different deliverables that need to be done that week and the lead that week can assign different tasks to each member, ensuring an even split of work while maintaing good organization. If problems arise, like a member having a lot of other commitments that week, other member can balance the load of work to help each other out.
5. **Time Commitment** 
The time commitment expected should be around anywhere from two to five hours of work per week. Depending on the deliverable, this may take less or more time. In these cases, work can be redsitributed or other members can help out if one is doing too much work that week. It is up to the team to make sure all work is done by the deliverable date, so everyone will work together to make an even time commitment.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
All conflicts, should they arise, will be handled through some sort of majority vote between all members. However, hopefully this will not happen, but all problems will be professionally handled through good communication.
